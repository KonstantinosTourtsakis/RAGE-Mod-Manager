# RAGE Mod Manager
A simple mod manager written in Python

## Description
RAGE Mod Manager is a simple mod manager written in Python. This tool can be used to automatically install/uninstall mods to GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA IV.

# Important note
The tool only works properly for the Rockstar Games Launcher version of these games. The reason is because it is using a list where are all game  file names are stored. As you may know, Steam and Epic Games versions of the games include some extra files in their root directory. I will update this repository soon and bring full support for all versions soon.

## Requirements
Python3 is required to use this tool. Download and install the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you can't find the download link, choose a version of Python3, scroll all the way down and download `Windows installer (64-bit)`. Then use it to install Python.

## Installation
- Make sure [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed
- Extract the `RAGE Mod Manager` folder in the same drive where your games are located (the tool won't work if its in a separate drive)
- Open `RAGEModManager.py` file using a text editor (ex: Notepad). Add the path to your game folders as well as the path to the provided mods folder ( GTA IV Mods, GTA V Mods, RDR2 Mods)
