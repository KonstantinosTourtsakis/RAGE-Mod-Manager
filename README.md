# RAGE Mod Manager
A simple mod manager written in Python

## Description
RAGE Mod Manager is a simple mod manager written in Python. This tool can be used to automatically install/uninstall mods to GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA IV.

# Supported platforms:
- GTA V (RGL, Steam, Epic Games)
- Red Dead Redemption 2 (RGL, Steam, Epic Games)
- GTA IV (RGL)


## Requirements
Python3 is required to use this tool. Download and install the latest version of Python3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you can't find the download link, choose a version of Python3 (latest is suggested), scroll all the way down and download `Windows installer (64-bit)`. Then use it to install Python.

## Installation
- Make sure [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed
- Go to the mods folder of the game that you are going to be using this tool for. For example, for GTA V the folder is called "GTA V Mods". Inside that folder you will find a text file. Paste the path of your game inside that text file.
- Open `RAGEModManager.py` with Python to use the tool (Python should be selected by default so double clicking works too)
- Done :)
